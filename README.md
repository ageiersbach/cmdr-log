# CMDR Log

An Elite Dangerous event logger.

Works with [cmdr-log-cli](https://github.com/ageiersbach/cmdr-log-cli),
which reads the player log and sends the data to the rails app.

# Set up

_This is a work in progress_. Currently the applications would require a rust development environment
as well as a rails environment on your local machine. Eventually the rails app
can live anywhere, such as Heroku, while the cli tool would be downloadable as
an executable.
